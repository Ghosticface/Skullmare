                                        <p>All species in the universe of Skullmare are divided into 4 categories, often referred to as families:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                          <li>Human</li>

                                        <h3>Human Traits</h3>
                                        <img src="pixels/realmhuman.png" alt="">
                                        <p>
                                          - They have the traits of a normal human.<br>
                                          - Human strength.<br>
                                          - Everything in how they behave is human.<br>
                                          - Humans cannot migrate between realms in normal circumstances.<br>
                                          - A human can migrate between worlds if a Mythical or an Elderitch brings them along.<br>
                                          - Humans have normal red blood.
                                        </p>
                                        <hr>
                                      
                                        <h3>Elderitch Traits</h3>
                                        <img src="pixels/realmelderitch.png" alt="">
                                        <p>
                                          - All elderitches are based on the cosmic horror that is Lovecraft.<br>
                                          - They have black blood.<br>
                                          - They have a triangle mark anywhere on their body that is either an accessory worn by a citizen or a tattoo on a worker.<br>
                                          - The high leader has a tattoo that tends to be on a very delicate place (such as the eye, tongue, heart).<br>
                                          - An Elderitch can regenerate, but there's still a way to kill them by striking them on their triangle spot.<br>
                                          - A citizen, however, can be killed easily by anything and anywhere.
                                        </p>
                                      
                                        <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
                                          - You kill Heizenga by stabbing him through the eye.<br>
                                          - You kill Bermuda by stabbing him through the mouth or slitting his throat.<br>
                                          - You kill Latavan by impaling him through the heart.<br>
                                          - You kill Boroque by stabbing through the abdomen.<br>
                                          They will die.</p>
                                      
                                        <p style="font-size: 12px;">
                                          - You could compare a normal elderitch citizen to a superhuman/monster human.<br>
                                          - An elderitch is able to migrate between realms.
                                        </p>
                                      
                                        <hr>
                                      
                                        <h3>Cryptid Traits</h3>
                                        <img src="pixels/realmmycryptid.png" alt="">
                                        <p>
                                          - Cryptids are based on cryptic entities such as Mothman and Nessie.<br>
                                          - They may have either red or black blood.<br>
                                          - They are capable of migrating between realms.<br>
                                          - Some cryptids have animal-like shapes, while others appear more monstrous; this depends on the specific cryptid.<br>
                                          - Unlike eldritch beings, cryptids lack triangular marks. However, at least one of their limbs is entirely black, whether it be their hands, eyes, etc.<br>
                                          - Cryptids are not governed by districts but rather by states. Each state has its own rules. There are at least five states in the cryptid realm. A fun fact is that the cryptid realm and the eldritch realms are neighboring realms.
                                        </p>
                                      
                                        <h3>Mythical Traits</h3>
                                        <img src="pixels/realmmythical.png" alt="">
                                        <p>
                                          - Is based on a mythical entity.<br>
                                          - Depending on the mythical entity they are, their power is based on.<br>
                                          - A mythical entity can vary from blood compared to other entities.<br>
                                          - A mythical entity can shape-shift to their original myth form.<br>
                                        </p>
                                      
                                        <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
                                          - An unicorn humanoid can shape-shift to that of a unicorn.<br>
                                          - A sphinx can shape-shift to that of a sphinx.<br>
                                          - A mythical is mostly accompanied with an eternal weapon that comes within their anatomy or uses life energy to cast.
                                        </p>
                                      
                                        <p>
                                          - Their habitat does exist but is not ruled by anything; it is a free land where the rules of the jungle prevail.<br>
                                          - Just like an Elderitch, a Mythical can migrate from worlds.
                                        </p>
                                      
                                        <hr>
                                      
                                        <h3>Ethereal Traits</h3>
                                        <img src="pixels/realangel.png" alt="">
                                        <p>
                                          - The Ethereals are the highest power form.<br>
                                          - They do not look like normal Angels; the servants may look normal, but their leader does not.<br>
                                          - They have wings.<br>
                                          - All of the high leaders MUST have sclera eyes with white irises and have golden cuff-like bands on their hands.<br>
                                          - Most Ethereal's aesthetics apply to either Greek or Roman culture (such as the toga, golden jewelry, or olive strands).<br>
                                          - They are able to migrate through realms.<br>
                                          - Their strength is incredible and has the power to create new habitats from scratch.<br>
                                          - Most high leaders have more limbs.<br>
                                          - As ALLHAIL having multiple arms and PRAISE have having multiple wings, a servant only has 2 wings.<br>
                                          - Compared to the rest of the species who can migrate, they will need a specific transportation vehicle to go through worlds; however, a high leader Ethereal does not need a vehicle.<br>
                                          - An Ethereal always has the broken feature of a limb THAT needs to be SEEN.<br>
                                          - They have red blood.

                                            The Elderitch festival, or so called "Lovecraft festival" is a once in a
                                            1000 year celebration ( counting it in human years ) where all the 3
                                            districts from the world compete with one another;
                                            You could compare the whole event to the greeks participating in the
                                            olympics.

                                            Each district leader holds an event or competition where all the workers can
                                            compete in until the best group wins. The compettiton can be anything from
                                            puzzles, riddles to athletics and particular knowledge on specific subjects.

                                            Ocassionaly ties can occur, and when they do there is a 4th event that will
                                            be hosted by a previous leader of any district: They will rise from the
                                            depths of sand, and it will be a battle to the death, where again the
                                            subject could be about anything the previous Elder chooses.

                                            Note: The previous leaders of a district are reffered to as the "The Elders
                                            Of The depths/The Elders"
                                            <h3> The river bridge
                                            </h3>
                                            In these particular attires showed in the illustration you can see a couple
                                            of accessories which hold a deep meaning to the ones who have them. An
                                            example is the "river bridge" which represents a legend where the black
                                            waters are tinted of that color from the blood of the criminals getting
                                            poured in. ( This legend is found in Bermuda's district, so the workers from
                                            that district will be the ones wearing that charm. )
                                            <h3> The death three
                                            </h3>
                                            The death tree is actually a big cemetery for previous citizens and workers,
                                            and it is rumored that wishes, luck and the dreams of any of the people
                                            buried are held onto it.

                                  <span style="font-size: 12px;color: rgb(150, 102, 0);">  Often also referred to as the <em>Grim Reaper</em>, rulers of death, or graveyard wardens, </span>
                                    <p >
                                    The Reaper species belongs to the Eldritch family. Reapers are responsible for gathering souls from every living being on their day of their death in the Skullmare universe—humans, mythicals, elderitches, or cryptids; they take them all (Ofcourse excluding Ethereals). Poetic humans and other species alike often refer to them as the rulers of death. Most of the time, they remain invisible to the living unless specific conditions or circumstances arise or set.

                                    <h3>Other Facts and Rules</h3>
                                  
                                    <ul>
                                      <li>Reapers are good friends with vampires, cryptids, or other underworld like beings, especially with some shady ties to the <span style="color: goldenrod;">"fallen"</span> due to their association with the undead (excluding ghosts, souls, and soul dealers).</li>
                                      <li>Reapers are one of the oldest species, next to high leader elderitches and workers.</li>
                                      <li>Reapers always have a scythe as their main weapon. But some others carry extra tools such as knives, daggers etc;in case the victim defies their time of death. Scythes then don't come in very handy in such times.</li>
                                      <li>Often, reapers are the species that use a lot of makeup (don't question it; many other elderitches are also dumbfounded by this).</li>
                                      <li>Reapers are obligated to kill their opponent on time; if a certain amount of time passes, the living being transcends into something else they are not supposed to be, often referred to as "<em>soul amenias</em>" or "<em>soul dealers</em>." <em>Soul dealers</em> and reapers have an extreme head-to-head friction and often harbor mutual dislike.</li>
                                      <li>Reapers abide to the aesthetics that of real monsters <br>
                                        <li style="font-size: 12px; list-style: none; color: rgb(0, 97, 65);">for example, the M&amp;D are skeletons, and Amelie being a banshee</li>
                                    </ul>
                                  
                                  
                                    <h3>The reaper life</h3>

                                    <p>Reapers live in groups, clans, or conventions. Each reaper convention consists of five reapers: four hunters or guards and one head reaper who guides them through their job. Reapers are split into genders, with four presenting as masc and one as fem or vice versa. <em>The Head reapers</em> are a tad different from normal reapers in either experience, combat skills, and the number of souls they can reap—their power is more advanced compared to other reapers.</p>
                                  
                                    <p>An interesting case for reapers is that while they live in the elderitch realm under the high district leaders, they are not quite governed. As long as they adhere to the leaders' rules, they can do whatever they want. However, because of this freedom, some adverse consequences may arise.</p>
                                    <p><span style="color: red;">Can reapers procreate?</span>Yes they technically can tho, their babies look like shadow beings, and reapers are only allowed to procreate after they retire. Retired reapers are referred to as "<em>past coffins</em>."</p>
