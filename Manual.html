                                            The Elderitch festival, or so called "Lovecraft festival" is a once in a
                                            1000 year celebration ( counting it in human years ) where all the 3
                                            districts from the world compete with one another;
                                            You could compare the whole event to the greeks participating in the
                                            olympics.

                                            Each district leader holds an event or competition where all the workers can
                                            compete in until the best group wins. The compettiton can be anything from
                                            puzzles, riddles to athletics and particular knowledge on specific subjects.

                                            Ocassionaly ties can occur, and when they do there is a 4th event that will
                                            be hosted by a previous leader of any district: They will rise from the
                                            depths of sand, and it will be a battle to the death, where again the
                                            subject could be about anything the previous Elder chooses.

                                            Note: The previous leaders of a district are reffered to as the "Elders"
                                            <h3> The river bridge
                                            </h3>
                                            In these particular attires showed in the illustration you can see a couple
                                            of accessories which hold a deep meaning to the ones who have them. An
                                            example is the "river bridge" which represents a legend where the black
                                            waters are tinted of that color from the blood of the criminals getting
                                            poured in. ( This legend is found in Bermuda's district, so the workers from
                                            that district will be the ones wearing that charm. )
<h3>                                            The death three
</h3>
                                            The death tree is actually a big cemetery for previous citizens and workers,
                                            and it is rumored that wishes, luck and the dreams of any of the people
                                            buried are held onto it.
